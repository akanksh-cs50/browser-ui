# browser-ui

A web app to browse your server's files.

# About
This project was made as a replacement to the default directory listing when visiting a http server
![Big text showing the path and all the items below it in a filesystem directory](doc/example.png)

and make it look like this
![Filesystem directory contents with icons beside them to distinguish their type](doc/new.png)

## TODO
- [X] Search with client-side javascript.
- [X] Show current working directory in the UI itself.
- [ ] Sorting eg. date, size, alphabetical.
- [ ] Toggle hidden files/directories.
- [ ] User Auth (probably the most important feature).
