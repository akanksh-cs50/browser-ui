Basically a custom ui / rice instead of whatever the default looks like when doing ```python -m http.server``` and looking at a directory.
I'll have search, icons for every entry like audio file, directory, text, programming language file.
I'll use fontawesome or symbols only nerd font for that.
It will look like a fancy ls like [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza).

The default is like this:

# Directory listing for /

- bin@
- boot/
- dev/
- etc/
- home/
- initrd.img@
- initrd.img.old@
- lib@
- lib64@
- lost+found/
- media/
- mnt/
- opt/
- proc/
- root/
- run/
- sbin@
- srv/
- sys/
- tmp/
- usr/
- var/
- vmlinuz@
- vmlinuz.old@

But with mine I'll have something which combines the look of explorer.exe and ls-icons.
